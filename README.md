# README

A tool to visualize the tables and relationships in an SQL SELECT query without any prior knowledge of the schema.

Heavily inspired by the *Snowflake Joins*, but as that's apparently disappeared from the internet, I decided to write my own.

## Install

1. `git clone https://github.com/Cole-Maguire/sql-draw`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run-script build`
4. Open `./index.html` in your favourite browser

## Known Issues/TODO

* No support for subqueries/`WHERE EXISTS`, etc.
* The UI. I mean... just look at it.
